Shortly after 11am I get a slack message from my Senior Director. He had just finished a all-hands meeting about the company's plan to manage the shifting landscapes caused by the recent outbreak of COVID-19. It's been a slow few weeks- contract hours were drying up and those projects on the horizon were being pushed back every day. With an ever increasing amount of uncertainty across the country, and me being the last contracted software developer in the company, I knew this was it. My partner shot me a look of reassurance as I scurried off into another room to take the call.

Dang.

For the last year I've been a remote contractor for a leadership development firm developing industry solutions for Fortune 500 companies (The Big Four) with thousands of users. As the software developer for each project I had the opportunity to design and build these solutions and watch them be used at training events worldwide. Utilizing modern libraries and like React, MobX for state-management, Material and SCSS for styling, D3 for data visulization, and Python for our DB, these simulations aimed to provide a stellar training experience for up-and-coming leaders. Watching a thousand people cram into a conference room to use your app and play competitively against their coworkers was a really great experience.

Until a global pandemic hits.

Big yikes. Responsible conference organizers slammed that cancel button overnight as new cases of COVID-19 skyrocketed. Many governments issued mandatory quarantine in hopes of _lowering the curve_, so I definitely had expected a call like this one was coming.. But as a company that primarily builds software, why would we be affected by this as much? Our entire team was remote and we've been having an incredibly successful year.

What happened?

Unfortunately, one of the more important aspects our apps were the conferences they were demo'd in. With the company's model focused on the facilitation of an event, rather than the software, clients were encouraged to cancel expensive contracts in favor of solutions that were easier to provide to a more broad audience, without the need for gathering in person and creating unnecessary health risks.

Thankfully, I had accomplished a whole lot in my first year as a software developer. Being on an agile delivery team that pumped out new and state-of-the-art data-driven simulations every few months was a total blast and gave me a great sense of satisfaction and self-worth. I'm excited and optimistic that these experiences will lead to new opportunities.

Thanks
