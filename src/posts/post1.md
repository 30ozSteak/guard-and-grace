It's shortly after 11am when I get a slack message from my Senior Director. He had just finished a all-hands meeting about the company's plan to manage the shifting landscapes caused by the recent outbreak of COVID-19. It's been a slow few weeks- contract hours were drying up as another round of projects were coming to a close and those on the horizon were being pushed back every day. With the dark cloud of COVID-19 threatening more setbacks, and me being the last contracted software developer in the company, I knew this was it. My partner shot me a look of reassurance as I scurried off into another room to take the call.

Dang.

For the last year I've been a remote contractor for _Regis Company_, a leadership development firm designing and developing industry solutions for Fortune 500 companies (including the Big Four) with thousands of users. As the software developer for each project I had the opportunity to design and build these solutions and watch them be used at training events worldwide. Utilizing modern libraries and like React, MobX for state-management, Material and SCSS for styling, and Python for our DB, these simulations aimed to provide a stellar training experience for up-and-coming leaders. Watching a thousand people cram into a conference room to use your app and play competitively against their coworkers was a really neat scene... Until a pandemic hits.

Big yikes. Responsible conference organizers around the world hit the pause button night as new cases of COVID-19 skyrocketed. Many states issued a mandatory quarantine for non-essential personnel to stay home in hopes of _lowering the curve_- so for me to have not seen that unsure waters were ahead would have been nothing but an exercise in ignorance.

But as a company that primarily makes software, why would we be affected by this as much as we are? How could this had been avoided to ensure that the staff creating your product understands that their time and efforts have had value at the company?

Unfortunately, one of the more important aspect of the conferences (and the company's business model as a whole) was their facilitation. Less emphasis was placed on the software and the capabilities of the developers on the team and instead it was placed on a group of individuals facilitating these events in person, telling the users what to do next, or what to do next. As such, every part of the system collapsed upon itself

So what do I do next? I'm not exactly sure. I'm hoping that creating this and writing about code more often I'm able to be an advocate for the capabilities of software developers everywhere, provide a detailed look at the benefits of remote work and navigating uncertainty, and maybe get a new job.

Thanks
